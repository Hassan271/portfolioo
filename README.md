Short Introduction:

I’m Hassan Farooq, with an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. Since 2016, I’ve been working in IT networking at Ibrahim Fibres Ltd, gaining hands-on experience in industrial systems, network infrastructure, and automation. 
I’m now looking for an entry-level software development role at a forward-thinking company where I can apply my technical background and grow in modern software technologies.
